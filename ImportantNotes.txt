This is the microservice, which is going to be consumed by SpringCloudEurekaClient via eureka server. 
In order to test load balancing(and elimination of inactive service ids in eureka server) and all those things, 
we need to spin up three or more instances of this microservice.

One instance is going to be started in eclipse itself. In order to start the other 2 or more instances, we need to open command prompt,
go to the directory "SpringCloudEurekaClient2" and type the below command:

mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--server.port=8085

by giving different port numbers to spin up multiple instances in different ports.

Now hit client2 from client and monitor the consoles of the three instances. You will see the instances load balanced.
